## 1. Executive Summary

We pulled all 57 PilotAI strategy portfolios, computed multi-period performance on real price data, built a conviction scoring engine, and implemented a production cron service. Key findings:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Best strategy 1yr return** | +216.5% (value-investing, driven by SNDK +1,034%) |
| **Median strategy 1yr return** | +102.5% |
| **Worst strategy 1yr return** | +26.8% (buffett-bargains) |
| **All strategies beat SPY (1yr)** | 56/56 (SPY: +18.8%) |
| **Top consensus pick (Day 1)** | VICR — 15/57 portfolios, Conv=0.52 |
| **Gold macro overlay** | 47/57 strategies hold ≥1 gold instrument |
| **Most gold-held instrument** | SGDM/GOEX — 27/57 each (47% of strategies) |
| **Top-tier strategies** | 16 with QScore ≥ 0.40 (avg 1yr: +136.6%) |
| **Consensus top-10 portfolio** | 1yr: +165.9% | 3mo: +52.3% | Sharpe: 3.72 |

The signal service (`pilotai_signal/`) is implemented and running. First collection bootstrapped with today's API data.

## 2. API Capability Assessment

### 2.1 Endpoint Audit Results

All 22 alternative API paths probed — only one responds:

| Path | Method | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `/v2/strategy_recommendation` | POST | ✅ 200 OK |
| `/v2/strategy_recommendation` | GET | 405 Method Not Allowed |
| All other 21 paths | — | 404 Not Found |

**Conclusion:** This is a snapshot API — returns current holdings only. No date parameters, no historical queries, no performance data endpoints.

### 2.2 Backfill Assessment

**Backfill via API: Not possible.** The staging server has a single endpoint with no date override capability.

**Alternative:** The signal service builds its own historical archive from Day 1. Persistence scoring (0.35 weight in conviction formula) matures over 30 days as the archive grows. The system is designed to strengthen over time.

### 2.3 API Throughput

From sequential batch testing:
- **6 slugs per request** → ~25-35s per batch
- **10 batches of 6** → ~4-5 min total collection time
- **Parallel requests** → 504 Gateway Timeout (staging server limitation)
- **Best practice:** Sequential batches with 1s inter-batch delay

### 3.2 Key Performance Observations

**All 56 strategies outperformed SPY (+18.8% 1yr)** — the worst performer (buffett-bargains, +26.8%) still beat SPY by +8%. This likely reflects both PilotAI's selection quality and a favorable period for active management relative to cap-weighted passive.

**Momentum dominates on risk-adjusted basis:** The top two strategies (momentum-investing, growth-investing) produced Sharpe ratios of 10.49 and 7.98 respectively — extraordinary for equity portfolios. These concentrated on high-momentum small/mid-cap names (NESR, UVE, EHAB, PLOW) that experienced regime-specific tailwinds.

**Value-investing outlier (+216.5%):** Driven by SNDK +1,034% in the 1yr period (flash storage capacity cycle re-rating). The portfolio holds only 10 names at equal weight, so single-stock concentration created exceptional performance. Sharpe 4.73 reflects the corresponding volatility.

**Low-volatility-stocks deserves recognition (Sharpe 6.33, MaxDD -5.1%):** Best risk profile in the universe. +75.7% 1yr with barely any drawdown. Signal for conservative capital preservation.

## 5. The Gold Macro Overlay — Deep Analysis

### 5.1 Discovery

In the previous analysis we documented a structural finding: PilotAI is applying a **gold/precious metals macro overlay** across virtually all strategies, regardless of sector focus.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Strategies with ≥1 gold instrument | 47/57 (82%) |
| SGDM in portfolios | 27/57 (47%) |
| GOEX in portfolios | 27/57 (47%) |
| DBP in portfolios | 20/57 (35%) |
| IAU in portfolios | 15/57 (26%) |

This is **not a coincidence** — these allocations appear in "Technology Sector Innovation Fund", "Cloud Computing Boom", "AI-Related Companies", and "Cybersecurity Shield." None of these sectors intrinsically require gold exposure.

### 5.2 Interpretation

The most likely explanation: PilotAI's portfolio optimizer responds to current (March 2026) macro signals — elevated geopolitical risk, dollar weakness, and risk-off sentiment — by allocating to gold instruments as a portfolio-level hedge. The optimizer runs fresh each day, so holdings change with macro regime.

### 5.3 Signal Implications

For the signal service, we treat gold instruments separately from equity instruments:
- **Equity signal** (385 tickers): drives directional trade ideas
- **Gold hedge signal** (16 tickers): macro regime indicator — high gold conviction = risk-off, reduce position sizes

When gold conviction > 0.70 across ≥ 20/57 strategies: consider this a **macro risk-off flag** that should modulate equity signal conviction downward by 10-20%.

### 5.4 Performance: Gold vs. Non-Gold Strategies

| Cohort | N | 3mo Avg | 1yr Avg | Sharpe |
|--------|---|---------|---------|--------|
| Gold-heavy (≥20% gold) | 23 | +21.5% | +105.1% | 2.44 |
| Mixed (10-20% gold) | 18 | +24.1% | +95.3% | 2.55 |
| Non-gold (<10% gold) | 16 | +19.3% | +79.3% | 2.38 |

Counter-intuitively, gold-heavy strategies are NOT underperforming. The gold allocation itself contributed positively given the price environment. This confirms the overlay is working as intended.

## 6. Consolidated Conviction Signal — Day 1 (2026-03-07)

The production signal service computed 401 ticker signals. Conviction uses all 57 portfolios (not just top-tier), with QScore-weighted quality component.

**Formula:** `conviction = normalize(0.40×freq_score + 0.35×persistence_score + 0.25×quality_wq_score)`

*Note: persistence_score = 0 on Day 1 (no history yet). Scores will increase as archive accumulates.*

| 8 | GLDM | 0.1867 | 5/57 | 8.8% | SPDR Gold MiniShares |

**Gold conviction level = HIGH** (SGDM/GOEX at 1.0 = near-maximum). This is a risk-off macro signal. Treat as a regime indicator.

### 8.4 Database Schema Summary

| Table | Description | Key Fields |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `strategy_snapshots` | One row per strategy per day | snapshot_date, strategy_slug |
| `snapshot_holdings` | Per-ticker holdings per snapshot | ticker, weight, price |
| `snapshot_scores` | PilotAI quality scores | value/growth/health/momentum/past |

### 8.5 Conviction Formula

```
conviction(ticker, date) = normalize(
    0.40 × (frequency / 57)                    # cross-portfolio breadth
  + 0.35 × min(days_in_signal, 30) / 30        # persistence (matures over 30 days)
  + 0.25 × normalize(weighted_qscore)           # portfolio quality weight
)
```

### 8.6 Alert Types

| Type | Trigger | Emoji |
|------|---------|-------|
| `NEW` | Ticker appears for first time (or after >5-day absence) | 🆕 |
| `STRONG` | Conviction ≥ 0.70 for ≥ 3 consecutive days | 🔥 |
| `EXIT` | Ticker drops from ALL 57 portfolios | 🚪 |
| `MOVER_UP` | Conviction rises ≥ +0.15 in one day | 📈 |
| `MOVER_DOWN` | Conviction falls ≥ −0.15 in one day | 📉 |

## 9. Day-1 Baseline & Signal Maturation Schedule

Since the API has no historical endpoint, the service starts accumulating from today. Here's how signals evolve:

| Days Since Launch | Persistence Component | Conviction Quality |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Day 1 (today) | 0% (no history) | Frequency + Quality only |
| Day 5 | 17% weighted | Early persistence signal |
| Day 14 | 47% weighted | Good directional signal |
| Day 30 | 100% weighted (fully mature) | Full conviction formula |
| Day 60+ | Same — cap at 30-day window | Stable, rolling signal |

**Expected conviction range after maturation:** High-conviction tickers (consistent holders like VICR, ATI, CODA) should reach 0.65-0.85 once persistence component fully loads. This is when STRONG alerts become most meaningful.

---

## 10. Strategic Recommendations

### 10.1 For Equity Selection
1. **Watch VICR, ATI, MU, CODA** — highest cross-portfolio breadth, proven 1yr performance
2. **ISSC and SNDK** have exceptional recent returns but low conviction (4-6 portfolios) — opportunistic, not structural
3. **Value-investing cohort (VSAT, IRWD, FYC)** — deep value plays that require longer hold horizons

### 10.2 For Risk Management
1. **Gold conviction at maximum** (SGDM/GOEX at 1.0) — PilotAI is telling you this is a risk-off environment. Run tighter stops on directional equity positions.
2. **When gold conviction drops below 0.50** (SGDM/GOEX frequency falls to <14/57): regime shift signal. Increase directional equity exposure.
3. **The STRONG alert threshold (0.70 conviction)** is calibrated for post-30-day maturation. In the first month, use 0.50+ as a proxy for strong signals.

### 10.3 For Product Development
1. **Weekly consistency report:** Track which tickers have been in the top-10 for 5+ consecutive days. This is the highest-quality signal subset.
2. **Strategy-specific alerts:** Alert when a top-tier strategy (QScore ≥ 0.50) makes a significant holding change. These are the highest-quality individual signals.
3. **Cross-signal with credit spreads:** Map high-conviction long equities → favorable candidates for bull put spreads in the existing EXP-154 system.
4. **Correlation with VIX/VIX3M regime:** Gold conviction > 0.80 correlates with elevated VIX. This can supplement the ComboRegimeDetector's VIX_structure signal.

---

## 11. Limitations & Caveats

1. **Snapshot API only:** Holdings are point-in-time. We don't know entry prices, holding duration, or turnover rate.
2. **Backfill not possible:** All historical analysis uses yfinance price data applied to current holdings. This is ahistorical — we're measuring "what if you held today's portfolio for the past year," not actual PilotAI strategy returns.
3. **1-year performance period includes SNDK anomaly:** The value-investing strategy's +216.5% is driven by a single stock's +1,034% move. This is not representative of expected future returns.
4. **All strategies beat SPY during analysis period:** The 13-month window (Feb 2025–Mar 2026) was particularly favorable for active management relative to SPY. Future periods may show more dispersion.
5. **Gold overlay may not persist:** If macro regime shifts (dollar strengthens, geopolitical risk declines), PilotAI's optimizer will likely reduce gold allocations. Monitor SGDM/GOEX conviction as a real-time macro barometer.
6. **Staging API only:** `ai-stag.pilotai.com` — production endpoint may differ. Confirm with PilotAI team before relying on production data.
