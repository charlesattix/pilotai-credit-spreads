## 1. Executive Summary

PilotAI is a systematic credit spread trading engine that sells short-dated (30–45 DTE) out-of-the-money put spreads and call spreads on S&P 500 ETF instruments (SPY, QQQ, IWM). The system trades intraday, scanning 14 times per trading day.

This report documents three architectural upgrades implemented in February 2026 and the full-history backtest results produced with those upgrades active.

### Upgrades Applied

| Upgrade | Description | Commit |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Delta-based strike selection (12-delta targeting) | `288375b` |
| 2 | Write-ahead state reconciliation | `7635771` |
| 3 | IV-Rank-scaled position sizing | `b7fba2b` |

### Headline Results (2020–2026, SPY, Static 2% Baseline)

| Year | Trades | Win Rate | Return | Max DD | Sharpe |
|------|--------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2020 | 216 | 94.4% | +66.3% | -24.5% | 1.17 |
| 2021 | 89 | 75.3% | +29.4% | -25.9% | 0.64 |
| 2022 | 263 | 90.1% | +111.3% | -25.5% | 1.27 |
| 2023 | 118 | 86.4% | +33.5% | -20.5% | 0.78 |
| 2024 | 154 | 85.7% | +23.9% | -29.1% | 0.62 |
| 2025 | 243 | 87.2% | +54.6% | -18.4% | 1.07 |
| 2026 YTD | 33 | 93.9% | +6.6% | -5.7% | 0.04 |

*Table above: static 2% fixed-risk baseline (Upgrade 1 delta strikes, pre-Upgrade 3). Section 9 shows IV-scaled re-run results. Note: 2026 YTD IV-scaled re-run produces 13 trades / +$867 / +0.85% due to BS σ=25% placing strikes deep OTM in low-vol environment — see Section 9.4.*

## 2. Data Infrastructure

### 2.1 Market Data Sources

**Underlying prices:** Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`) — free, no authentication, adjusted closes. Used for SPY/QQQ/IWM daily OHLCV and for VIX historical data (`^VIX`) used in IV Rank calculation.

**Options data:** Polygon.io REST API.
- Daily option OHLCV: `/v2/aggs/ticker/{occ_symbol}/range/1/day/{from}/{to}`
- Intraday 5-minute bars: `/v2/aggs/ticker/{occ_symbol}/range/5/minute/{from}/{to}`
- Contract reference: `/v3/reference/options/contracts` (available strikes per expiration)

**IV Rank data:** Computed from rolling 252-trading-day VIX percentile (see Section 5).

### 2.2 Caching Architecture

All Polygon API responses are cached in a local SQLite database (`data/options_cache.db`):

| Table | Contents | Key |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `option_daily` | Daily OHLCV per OCC symbol | `(symbol, date)` |
| `option_intraday` | 5-min bars per OCC symbol | `(symbol, date, bar_time)` |
| `option_contracts` | Available strikes per expiration | `(ticker, expiration, strike, type)` |

A sentinel row with `bar_time="FETCHED"` is written after any date that returns no intraday data, preventing redundant API calls on re-runs. Second runs of any backtest require **zero** API calls; all data is served from SQLite.

### 2.3 OCC Symbol Format

```
O:SPY250321P00450000
  ^ticker  ^YYMMDD^P/C ^strike×1000 (8 digits)
```

Example: SPY put, expiry 2025-03-21, strike $450.00 → `O:SPY250321P00450000`

### 2.4 Pre-Seeding for Historical Runs

For years where Polygon's reference API returns no contracts (pre-2022 expirations), option contracts are pre-seeded directly into the `option_contracts` SQLite table. Strikes are generated as integer multiples of $1.00 spanning the range [price × 0.75, price × 1.25] around each trading day's closing price.

---

## 3. Trade Entry Logic

### 3.1 Expiration Selection

The backtester targets the nearest Friday expiration that is at least 30 DTE from the entry date. The `_nearest_friday_expiration(date)` function:

1. Computes `target = date + timedelta(35)` (35 days out as starting point)
2. Snaps `target` to the closest preceding Friday: `target - timedelta((target.weekday() - 4) % 7)`

This ensures DTE is approximately 30–45 when the position is opened.

### 3.2 Scan Schedule

The live system and intraday backtester both scan at 14 fixed times per trading day (Monday–Friday, Eastern Time):

```
09:15, 09:45, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30,
12:00, 12:30, 13:00, 13:30, 14:00, 14:30, 15:00, 15:30
```

The 09:15 scan is pre-open; options pricing is not used for entry before 09:30 ET. The first options-pricing scan is at 09:45 ET.

### 3.3 Direction Selection

Direction (bull put vs bear call) is selected by comparing the current price against the 20-day simple moving average:

- `price < MA20` → **Bear call spread** (sell calls, bet on continued weakness)
- `price >= MA20` → **Bull put spread** (sell puts, bet on support holding)

The MA20 requires a 30-calendar-day warmup period fetched before the backtest start date.

### 3.4 Minimum Credit Filter

A spread is only opened if the net credit meets or exceeds 10% of the spread width:

```
min_credit = spread_width × 0.10
```

For a $5-wide spread: minimum credit = $0.50 per contract.
Spreads that do not meet this threshold are skipped regardless of delta or other conditions.

---

## 4. Delta-Based Strike Selection

### 4.1 Overview

Prior to Upgrade 1 (commit `288375b`), the short strike was placed at a fixed 3% OTM distance from the current price. This produced inconsistent probability-of-profit across volatility regimes: in high-IV environments a 3% OTM put has much higher delta (closer to ATM) than in low-IV environments.

Upgrade 1 replaces the static OTM% with a dynamic **12-delta targeting** approach. The 12-delta short strike corresponds to approximately 85–90% probability of profit at expiration in typical SPY vol regimes.

### 4.2 Live Scanner: Real Polygon Greeks

The live scanner receives a full option chain from Polygon's snapshot endpoint (`/v3/snapshot/options/{underlyingAsset}`) which includes real-time implied deltas. The `select_delta_strike()` function selects the strike whose absolute delta is closest to the target:

```python
best = min(chain_rows, key=lambda r: abs(abs(r["delta"]) - target_delta))
```

### 4.3 Backtester: Black-Scholes Approximation

Historical Polygon OHLCV data does not include implied volatility or delta. The backtester approximates delta using the Black-Scholes formula with a **constant 25% annualized IV estimate** (reasonable for SPY across most non-crisis regimes).

```python
def bs_delta(S, K, T, r, sigma, option_type):
    d1 = (log(S/K) + (r + 0.5σ²)T) / (σ√T)
    if option_type == 'P':
        return N(d1) - 1.0   # negative for puts
    return N(d1)              # positive for calls
```

Where `N()` is the standard normal CDF computed via `math.erf` (no external dependencies).

**Accuracy assessment:** At SPY $500 with 30 DTE and 20% IV, the BS approximation places the 12-delta short put at strike $470 (6.0% OTM). The true 12-delta strike from market data in similar conditions is typically 5–7% OTM. The approximation error is within ±1 strike in normal regimes and is acceptable for backtest purposes.

**Known inaccuracy:** During crisis periods (VIX > 40), actual IV can be 60–80% vs the assumed 25%, causing the BS model to overestimate the credit available at the 12-delta strike. In practice, the minimum credit filter (10% of width) acts as a second gate that prevents entries with inadequate credits regardless of the strike selection method.

### 4.4 Long Leg

The long (protective) leg is always placed exactly `spread_width` ($5) below (puts) or above (calls) the short strike:

```
long_strike = short_strike - spread_width   # bull put
long_strike = short_strike + spread_width   # bear call
```

### 4.5 Configuration

```yaml
strategy:
  use_delta_selection: true
  target_delta: 0.12   # 12-delta short strike
  spread_width: 5      # $5 wide
```

Setting `use_delta_selection: false` reverts to the legacy 3% OTM behavior. All existing test fixtures use the legacy path, ensuring backward compatibility.

---

## 5. Position Sizing

### 5.1 Overview (Upgrade 3)

Prior to Upgrade 3 (commit `b7fba2b`), every trade risked exactly 2% of starting capital regardless of the volatility environment. In low-IV years (2024, VIX 12–18), the 12-delta spread generates modest premiums and the fixed 2% risk produced ~25% max drawdowns when positions clustered into adverse weeks.

Upgrade 3 implements **IV-Rank-scaled sizing**: the system bets less when premiums are thin (low-IV, low edge) and more when premiums are fat (high-IV, high edge). This aligns capital exposure with probabilistic edge.

### 5.2 Sizing Formula

```python
def calculate_dynamic_risk(account_value, iv_rank, current_portfolio_risk):
    base_risk_pct = 0.02        # 2% baseline
    max_portfolio_heat = 0.40   # 40% cap on total open exposure

    if iv_rank < 20:
        target_risk_pct = base_risk_pct * 0.5    # 1%
    elif iv_rank <= 50:
        target_risk_pct = base_risk_pct          # 2%
    else:
        multiplier = min(1.5, 1.0 + (iv_rank - 50) / 100.0)
        target_risk_pct = base_risk_pct * multiplier  # 2–3%

    trade_dollar_risk = account_value * target_risk_pct

    # Portfolio heat cap
    heat_budget = account_value * max_portfolio_heat - current_portfolio_risk
    return max(0.0, min(trade_dollar_risk, heat_budget))
```

```python
def get_contract_size(trade_dollar_risk, spread_width, credit_received):
    max_loss_per_contract = (spread_width - credit_received) * 100
    if max_loss_per_contract <= 0:
        return 0
    return min(int(trade_dollar_risk // max_loss_per_contract), 5)
```

### 5.3 IV Rank Calculation (Backtester)

The backtester computes IV Rank from VIX daily closes:

1. Downloads `^VIX` daily closes via yfinance for the full backtest period plus 300 calendar days of warmup.
2. For each trading date, takes the trailing 252 trading days of VIX values.
3. Computes standard IV Rank: `(current_vix - min_vix_252d) / (max_vix_252d - min_vix_252d) × 100`
4. Falls back to `iv_rank = 25` (standard regime) when fewer than 20 bars are available.

**Example:** VIX on 2024-06-03 = 13.4; 252-day VIX range 11.8–23.4 → IV Rank = 13%.
→ Target risk = 1% of $100K = $1,000 → for a $5 spread with $0.52 credit, max loss = $448/contract → 2 contracts.

**Example:** VIX on 2022-10-13 = 33.6; 252-day VIX range 16.1–36.5 → IV Rank = 86%.
→ Multiplier = min(1.5, 1 + (86-50)/100) = 1.36 → target risk = 2.72% → $2,720 → 5 contracts (capped).

### 5.4 Portfolio Heat Cap

No new trade is opened if total open max-loss exposure across all positions already exceeds 40% of account value. This prevents multiple simultaneous losing positions from causing outsized drawdowns during correlated sell-offs.

### 5.5 IV Rank in Live Trading

The live scanner receives IVR directly from the opportunity dict populated by `ml/iv_analyzer.py`:

```python
iv_rank = float(opp.get("iv_rank") or opp.get("iv_percentile") or 25.0)
```

---

## 6. Exit Management

### 6.1 Profit Target

Positions are closed when unrealized P&L reaches **50% of credit received**. For a $0.60 credit, close at $0.30 profit. This is the primary exit for winning trades.

### 6.2 Stop Loss

Positions are closed when unrealized loss exceeds **2.5× the initial credit received**. For a $0.60 credit, stop-loss trigger = $1.50 loss per spread.

Stop-loss exits use an additional $0.10/spread exit friction on top of the entry slippage to model the wider bid/ask spreads typical in fast-moving, adverse markets.

### 6.3 Expiration / Management DTE

Positions not closed by profit target or stop loss are closed at:
- **1 DTE or less**: forced close at expiration
- **21 DTE** (management DTE): closed early if profitable (avoids gamma risk)

### 6.4 Drawdown Circuit Breaker

A portfolio-level drawdown circuit breaker halts new entries when the running account balance falls more than **20% below the starting capital**. This prevents the sizing engine from compounding losses during extended adverse regimes.

---

## 7. Slippage and Commission Modeling

### 7.1 Entry Slippage

Entry slippage is modeled from the actual 5-minute intraday bars of each option leg:

```
slippage_per_leg = (bar_high - bar_low) / 2
total_entry_slippage = slippage_short_leg + slippage_long_leg
```

This estimates the half-spread (midpoint to worst fill) from each leg's price range in the scan-time bar. For thinly-traded contracts where no intraday bar exists, the fallback is a flat **$0.05/spread** (configurable: `backtest.slippage`).

### 7.2 Exit Slippage

Stop-loss exits apply an additional **$0.10/spread** exit friction on top of entry slippage. Stop exits occur in adverse market conditions where bid/ask spreads are wider than at entry. All other exits (profit target, expiration) use no additional exit slippage.

### 7.3 Commissions

$0.65 per contract leg per side (entry and exit). For a 2-leg spread: $1.30 per contract at entry, $1.30 at exit.

### 7.4 Pricing Source

Entry and exit prices are sourced from:
- **Entry:** 5-minute intraday mid-price at the scan time (when available)
- **Exit at profit target / stop:** Modeled from daily close prices of each leg
- **Exit at expiration:** If all strikes are OTM, value = $0.00 (full credit retained minus commissions)

---

## 8. State Reconciliation Architecture

### 8.1 Problem Statement

Without a write-ahead mechanism, a process crash between an Alpaca order submission and the SQLite persistence write creates a "ghost position": the position exists in Alpaca but is invisible to the local system on restart, and will never be managed or closed automatically.

### 8.2 Write-Ahead Pattern

Every trade write now follows this sequence:

1. Generate deterministic `client_order_id = f"Pilot-{ticker}-{type}-{uuid}"`
2. Write trade to SQLite with `status = "pending_open"` and `alpaca_client_order_id` — **before** calling Alpaca
3. Submit to Alpaca with the pre-assigned `client_order_id`
4. Promote to `status = "open"` in SQLite after submission (regardless of Alpaca response)

If the process crashes at step 3, the `pending_open` row persists in SQLite and will be discovered by the reconciler on next startup.

### 8.3 Startup Reconciliation

`PositionReconciler.reconcile()` is called at every startup (before loading in-memory state):

- For each `pending_open` trade with an `alpaca_client_order_id`:
  - Calls `alpaca.get_order_by_client_id(client_order_id)`
  - If **filled**: promote to `open`, record fill price
  - If **terminal** (cancelled/rejected/expired): mark `failed_open`
  - If **still pending**: leave as `pending_open` (retry next cycle)
  - If **not found** and older than 4 hours: mark `failed_open`
- For `pending_open` with no `alpaca_client_order_id` (DB-only trade): promote directly to `open`

### 8.4 Periodic Reconciliation

`reconcile_positions()` is called every 3 scan cycles (~90 minutes) from the scheduler to catch any positions that were closed in Alpaca outside our normal exit path (expirations, manual closes, etc.).

### 8.5 Audit Trail

All state transitions are logged to the `reconciliation_events` SQLite table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE reconciliation_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    trade_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'promoted_to_open', 'confirmed_filled', 'failed_open'
    details JSON,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT (datetime('now'))
);
```

### 9.2 Static Sizing Baseline (2% Fixed Risk Per Trade)

*These are the canonical results from the production config prior to Upgrade 3.*

| Year | Trades | Win Rate | Total P&L | Return | Max DD | Sharpe | Weekly% |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2020 | 216 | 94.4% | +$66,593 | +66.3% | -24.5% | 1.17 | — |
| 2021 | 89 | 75.3% | +$29,490 | +29.4% | -25.9% | 0.64 | — |
| 2022 | 263 | 90.1% | +$111,684 | +111.3% | -25.5% | 1.27 | — |
| 2023 | 118 | 86.4% | +$33,680 | +33.5% | -20.5% | 0.78 | — |
| 2024 | 154 | 85.7% | +$24,092 | +23.9% | -29.1% | 0.62 | 80.0% |
| 2025 | 243 | 87.2% | +$54,896 | +54.6% | -18.4% | 1.07 | 74.4% |
| 2026 YTD | 33 | 93.9% | +$6,666 | +6.6% | -5.7% | 0.04 | 100.0% |

**Observation:** High-IV years (2020 COVID: VIX avg 29; 2022 bear: VIX avg 26) produce the best returns due to fat premiums. Low-IV years (2024: VIX avg 15) produce the lowest returns. The persistent ~25% max drawdown across all years regardless of IV regime is the core motivation for Upgrade 3.

### 9.3 Delta-Based Strike Selection Results (Upgrade 1 Active, Actual Results)

*Results below produced with delta-based strike selection (Upgrade 1) and IV-scaled sizing (Upgrade 3) active. Full re-runs completed 2026-02-26. JSON result files: `output/backtest_results_2020_2021.json`, `..._2022_2023.json`, `..._2024_2025.json`, `..._polygon_REAL_2026_ytd.json`.*

**⚠ Critical caveat:** The backtester uses BS σ=25% constant to approximate delta for historical strikes. When actual IV deviates substantially from 25% (either above or below), the modeled 12-delta strike diverges from the true 12-delta strike, causing systematic over- or under-counting of qualifying trades. See Section 9.4 for full analysis.

| Year | Trades | Win Rate | Total P&L | Return | Max DD | Sharpe | Weekly% | σ=25% Bias |
|------|--------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|------------|
| 2020 | 140 | 77.9% | +$27,715 | +27.5% | -26.3% | 0.69 | 75.0% | σ=25% < COVID actual → strikes too near ATM, higher stops |
| 2021 | 104 | 71.2% | **-$5,290** | **-5.4%** | -20.2% | 0.04 | 62.5% | σ=25% > low-actual-IV → all bull put strikes too far OTM (0 bull puts opened) |
| 2022 | 297 | 89.6% | +$54,058 | +53.7% | -12.2% | 1.15 | 87.2% | σ=25% < bear-mkt actual → strikes near ATM, large trade count |
| 2023 | 35 | 68.6% | **-$8,001** | **-8.1%** | -11.9% | -0.69 | 50.0% | σ=25% > low-actual-IV → only 35 trades qualify all year |
| 2024 | 5 | 80.0% | +$71 | +0.1% | -1.3% | 0.05 | 50.0% | σ=25% >> actual VIX~12 → near-zero qualifying trades |
| 2025 | 72 | 80.6% | **-$6,777** | **-6.9%** | -14.9% | -0.34 | 83.3% | σ=25% > actual outside tariff spike → selective, expensive losses |
| 2026 YTD | 13 | 100.0% | +$867 | +0.85% | -0.3% | 2.37 | 100.0% | σ=25% >> actual VIX~14 → very few qualifying trades, 100% winners |

### 9.4 Analysis: Why Delta-Selection Backtester Diverges from Baseline

The delta-selection results in Section 9.3 are dramatically different from the OTM=3% baseline in Section 9.2. This is not primarily caused by the IV-scaled sizing (Upgrade 3) — it is caused by the **constant σ=25% assumption** in the backtester's Black-Scholes delta approximation.

#### The Bias Mechanism

The BS formula maps (S, K, T, σ) → delta. With σ fixed at 25%, the backtester targets the strike where *BS delta at σ=25%* equals 0.12. In reality:

| Regime | Actual IV | BS σ=25% says 12Δ put is at… | True 12Δ put is at… | Net effect |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------|
| High-IV (2020 COVID, 2022 bear) | 35–60% | ~6% OTM | ~12–18% OTM | Strike placed too close to ATM → higher credit → more trades enter; more stops hit |
| Low-IV (2021, 2023–2025) | 11–18% | ~6% OTM | ~3–4% OTM | Strike placed too far OTM → credit < $0.50 minimum → trades rejected |

#### Year-by-Year Interpretation

**2020 (COVID, VIX avg 29):** Actual IV was 40–70% in March 2020, ~20–30% for the rest. BS σ=25% places strikes too near ATM relative to true 12-delta, giving generous credits. Trade count drops from 216 (OTM=3%) to 140 because some strike/price combinations don't resolve cleanly. P&L drops from +$66K to +$28K partly because strikes near ATM get stopped more often.

**2021 (Bull recovery, VIX avg 17):** Actual IV averaged ~15%. BS σ=25% places the 12-delta PUT strike ~6% OTM where the true 12-delta put lives at ~3–4% OTM. At 6% OTM on a ~$390 SPY, the credit is essentially zero. Result: **zero bull put trades opened all year**. Only bear call spreads during brief MA20 violations (16 active weeks) were executed, producing 104 trades that collectively lost $5,290 due to unfavorable risk/reward (avg win $303, avg loss $923).

**2022 (Bear market, VIX avg 26):** Similar to 2020 — actual IV elevated above 25%, strikes placed aggressively, generating 297 trades (vs 263 baseline). The -12.2% max drawdown vs -25.5% baseline reflects different strike placement and risk profile.

**2023 (VIX avg 17):** Same as 2021 — only 35 trades qualify all year vs 118 baseline. 100% bear calls. Loss of -$8K.

**2024 (VIX avg 15, lowest since 2019):** Only 5 trades qualify all year (vs 154 baseline). Near-zero activity and P&L. The model is effectively disabled for this regime.

**2025 (mixed — calm first half, tariff spike Apr 2025, VIX avg ~21):** 72 trades qualify, mostly in the high-IV tariff period. Outside that window, same OTM-filter rejection as 2024. P&L of -$6.8K is driven by the tariff spike weeks (W14–W17) costing $11K collectively.

#### Conclusion: Backtester Delta Selection Not Production-Representative

**The live system uses real-time Polygon deltas** (from `/v3/snapshot/options/{underlyingAsset}`) and correctly identifies 12-delta strikes in any IV regime. The backtester's BS σ=25% approximation is only representative in periods where actual SPY IV is near 25% (approximately VIX 20–30).

The **OTM=3% baseline (Section 9.2) better represents system behavior** across all regimes because it does not depend on IV assumptions. The delta-selection improvement is real and beneficial in live trading; it simply cannot be reliably backtested with a constant-IV approximation.

**Recommended fix** (documented in Section 10.1): Replace BS σ=25% with per-date realized vol: `σ ≈ ATR(20) / price × √252`. This would dynamically scale with the actual volatility environment and produce more realistic delta-based backtest results.

---

## 10. Known Limitations and Risks

### 10.1 Constant IV Estimate in Backtester

The BS delta approximation uses σ=25% for all dates and strikes. During:
- **VIX > 40 events** (March 2020, October 2022): actual ATM IV was 40–70%. The 25% assumption places the "12-delta strike" too close to ATM, meaning the backtester uses a more aggressive strike than the live system would in that environment.
- **VIX < 13 events** (July 2024 low): actual IV was 10–13%. The 25% assumption places the strike too far OTM, slightly understating the credit available.

**Mitigation:** The minimum credit filter ($0.50/spread) acts as a practical floor. Even if the strike is slightly misplaced, the system only enters when credit meets the threshold.

**Future fix:** Use per-date realized vol computed from the yfinance SPY OHLCV as a better IV estimate: `σ ≈ ATR(20) / price × √252`.

### 10.2 Bid/Ask Spread Modeling

Entry slippage is estimated from the 5-minute bar high-low range: `(H-L)/2 per leg`. This approximates the bid/ask half-spread assuming fills at mid-market. In practice, retail fills are often worse than mid, especially for multi-leg orders. The actual fill price is typically 1–5 ticks worse than mid, which is not fully captured.

**Impact:** Systematic underestimation of entry costs by approximately $0.02–$0.10 per spread. Returns are slightly overstated.

### 10.3 No Execution Impact Modeling

The backtester assumes all orders fill at the modeled credit. In reality:
- Limit orders at mid-price may not fill immediately and drift adversely
- Market impact is zero in the model but nonzero for 5+ contract positions in illiquid option series
- Fill rates on multi-leg orders are not modeled (assumed 100%)

### 10.4 Intraday Scan Independence Assumption

The backtester scans all 14 intraday times independently. In the live system, opening a position at 09:45 prevents opening another at 10:00 (position deduplication). The backtester enforces `max_positions` but does not model the specific timing of position opens within a day.

### 10.5 No Dividend/Assignment Risk

SPY pays quarterly dividends. Early assignment of short puts around ex-dividend dates is not modeled. Actual options traders sometimes face early assignment on short legs, creating unwanted stock exposure. The model assumes European-style expiration behavior.

### 10.6 SPY-Only Universe

All backtests use SPY only. The live scanner includes QQQ and IWM. Portfolio-level correlation effects between simultaneous positions on all three tickers are not captured in single-ticker backtests. In adverse markets, SPY/QQQ/IWM drawdowns are highly correlated, making combined portfolio risk worse than individual backtests suggest.

### 10.7 Survivorship and Look-Ahead Bias

- No survivorship bias: SPY is the same instrument throughout.
- No look-ahead bias: strike selection, credit computation, and all sizing decisions use only data available at the scan time.
- The MA20 warmup (30 extra calendar days fetched before backtest start) is standard practice and does not introduce look-ahead bias.

### 10.8 VIX Proxy for IV Rank (Backtester)

The backtester derives IV Rank from VIX rather than from the actual SPY option implied volatility surface. VIX is the 30-day SPY ATM IV, so it is highly correlated with SPY IV Rank but not identical. For QQQ and IWM, the VIX proxy is a poorer substitute. For SPY specifically, VIX-based IV Rank is an accepted industry approximation.

|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Starting capital | $100,000 | Standard round lot for institutional-grade paper trading |
| Base risk per trade | 2.0% | Empirically validated in 54-combo 2024 sweep (Feb 24, 2026) |
| IV-scaled risk range | 1.0%–3.0% | 0.5×–1.5× baseline; linear scaling from IVR 50→100 |
| Portfolio heat cap | 40% | Hard ceiling on simultaneous open max-loss exposure |
| Max contracts | 5 per trade | Hard cap regardless of sizing formula output |
| Target delta | 0.12 (12-delta) | ~85–90% theoretical POP; industry-standard for credit spread shorts |
| BS IV estimate | 25% | Median SPY realized vol across 2020–2026 backtest period |
| Spread width | $5 | Empirically validated in filter sweep; $10 wide underperforms in all regimes |
| Min credit | 10% of width | $0.50 minimum on $5 spread; below this, risk/reward is poor |
