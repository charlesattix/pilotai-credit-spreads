P0 CRITICAL PRIORITY (Carlos Directive - Feb 21, 11:38 AM)
================================================================================

"Top of the MASTERPLAN is to identify alert settings that yield positive 
trades and P&L every week of the year. This is THE critical priority. 
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS until this is resolved. Without this, the project 
is a MASSIVE FAILURE."

                        - Carlos Cruz, CEO

YOUR ONLY JOB UNTIL THIS IS COMPLETE:

1. Fix backtest/backtester.py to use REAL strategy.find_credit_spreads() 
   with full ML scoring (not simplified price > MA20 heuristics)

2. Help analyze find_profitable_settings.py output when it completes

3. Deploy winning configuration to production for Monday's scan

CURRENT STATUS:
- Charles is running systematic backtest matrix (find_profitable_settings.py)
- Testing 60 filter combinations with REAL Polygon historical data
- Will identify settings that produce consistent weekly profits
- Expected completion: ~10-15 minutes

DO NOT work on:
- ❌ Iron Condors (already deployed)
- ❌ Other strategy expansions
- ❌ Documentation
- ❌ Code cleanup
- ❌ ANYTHING except finding profitable settings

THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS.
